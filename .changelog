- don't support old /etc/modules.conf and put all config files
/etc/modprobe.d
- don't bother shipping 'COPYING' as it's provided by 'common-licenses'
package
- update license tag (GPL -> GPLv2+)
- consistently use %%{_sysconfdir} macro
- don't remove /sbin/insmod.static on %%{ix86}
- drop obsoletes on %%{_lib}modprobe0-devel
- use %%rename macro for module-init-tools-devel
- drop explicit library package name dependency
- remove ancient conflicts/obsoletes on modutils& devfsd
- use %%bcond for dietlibc build
- drop dead %%toalternate macro
- fix link order in xz patch

- merge changes from mageia:
  	o provide static tools
  	o reduce number of runtime warnings
  	o drop kernel 2.4 -> 2.6 module mapping which is uneeded for long
time
  	o drop patch 3 and move modprobe.default in modprobe.d
  	o drop patch 6 and move ldetect-lst in modprobe.d
  	  (still read before kernel aliases list)
  	o document remaining patches
  	o patch 9: rename warn() as mod_warn() (mga#3309):
  	o patch 10: API for quiet mode in ldetect
  	o patch 8: exit() is not a user-friendly user managment method in a
library
  	o move modprobe.default and modprobe.compat from /lib64 to /lib on
64-bit
  	  as they are plain text files and that is where modprobe looks for them
  	o do not automatically mount/umount binfmt_misc fs when binfmt_misc
  	  module is inserted/removed, it interferes with automatic modprobing
  	  by mount command and causes boot delays with systemd (mga #2246)
  	o rediff all patches
  	o Blacklist viafb (mga #1185)
- remove ancient trigger on some mdv2008.0 version
